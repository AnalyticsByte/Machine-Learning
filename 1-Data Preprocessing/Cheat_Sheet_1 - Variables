Below is a summary of which situations we have to apply LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder. When your variable has string values and is:

INDEPENDENT = The independent variable is the variable whose change isnâ€™t affected by 
              any other variable in the experiment

ORDINAL (Categorical + Ordering) = economic status (low,medium,high), Educational 
                                   Experience(high school, graduate, post-graduate)

NOMINAL (Categorical + no intrinsic ordering) = Gender (Male, Female), Hair Color(Black, 
                                                White, Blonde)

DEPENDENT = Dependend on other variable





THUMB Rule ::

INDEPENDENT & ORDINAL -> Manual Mapping

INDEPENDENT & NOMINAL -> LabelEncoder + OneHotEncoder

DEPENDENT & ORDINAL -> Manual Mapping

DEPENDENT & NOMINAL -> LabelEncoder
